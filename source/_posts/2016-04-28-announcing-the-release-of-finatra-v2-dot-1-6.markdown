###  Finatra [Release 2.1.6](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/releases/tag/v2.1.6) is now available from [Maven Central][maven-central].

As [previously noted](/finatra/blog/2016/04/26/announcing-our-final-scala-2-dot-10-and-java-7-release/), `Finatra 2.1.6` will be our **final release to support Scala 2.10 and Java 7**. Future releases will be Scala 2.11 and Java 8 *only* until Scala 2.12 support is added for [Finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle) at which time we'll cross-compile for Scala 2.11 and 2.12.

Please checkout the [v2.1.6](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/releases/tag/finatra-2.1.6) release notes on github for more information. As always, you can download the release from [Maven Central][maven-central].
