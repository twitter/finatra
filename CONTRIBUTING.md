# How to Contribute

We'd love to get patches from you!

## Building dependencies

We are not currently publishing snapshots for Finatra's dependencies, which
means that it may be necessary to build and publish the `develop` branches of dependencies locally 
in order to work on Finatra's `master` branch. To do this you should clone [TwitterServer][twitter-server-repo], 
[Finagle][finagle-repo], and [Util][util-repo], check out their `develop` branches, and run `./sbt +publishLocal` 
for each project.

We are planning to begin publishing snapshots soon, which will make these steps
unnecessary. If you have any questions or run into any problems, please create
an issue here, tweet at us at [@finatra](https://twitter.com/finatra), or email
the [finatra-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/finatra-users) mailing list.

## Workflow

We follow the [GitHub Flow Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

1.  Fork finatra
2.  Check out the `master` branch
3.  Create a feature branch
4.  Write code and tests for your change
6.  From your branch, make a pull request against `twitter/finatra/master`
7.  Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed
8.  Wait for your change to be pulled into `twitter/finatra/master`
9.  Delete your feature branch

## Testing

We've standardized on using the [ScalaTest testing framework][scalatest].
Because ScalaTest has such a big surface area, we use a restricted subset of it
in our tests to keep them easy to read.  We've chosen the `Matchers` API, and we use 
the [`WordSpec` mixin][wordspec]. Please mixin our [Test trait][test-trait] to get
these defaults.

Note that while you will see a [Travis CI][travis-ci] status message in your
pull request, all changes will also be tested internally at Twitter before being merged.

## Style

We generally follow the [Scala Style Guide][scala-style-guide]. When in doubt, look around the codebase and see how it's done elsewhere.

## Code Review

The Finatra repository on GitHub is kept in sync with an internal repository at
Twitter. For the most part this process should be transparent to Finatra users,
but it does have some implications for how pull requests are merged into the
codebase.

When you submit a pull request on GitHub, it will be reviewed by the
Finatra community (both inside and outside of Twitter), and once the changes are
approved, your commits will be brought into Twitter's internal system for additional
testing. Once the changes are merged internally, they will be pushed back to
GitHub with the next sync.

This process means that the pull request will not be merged in the usual way.
Instead a member of the Finatra team will post a message in the pull request
thread when your changes have made their way back to GitHub, and the pull
request will be closed (see [this pull request][pull-example] for an example). The changes
in the pull request will be collapsed into a single commit, but the authorship
metadata will be preserved.
