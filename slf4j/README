# Overview
# -------------------------------

The finatra framework uses SLF4J for logging.  By coupling the framework to only SLF4J, application developers
can choose the logging implementation.  Adding finatra-slf4j as a dependency adds an SLF4J bridge for the following logging providers:

  * log4j
  * java-util-logging,
  * commons-logging,
  * jdk14

# -------------------------------
# Logback Configuration
# -------------------------------

A sample Logback configuration is provided here:

slf4j/src/test/resources/Logback-sample.xml.

This configuration file makes use of log.access.output and log.service.output variables for configuring two appenders.
A variable's value is specified at runtime as a Java system property (e.g., -Dlog.service.output=myservice.log).
Additional variables may be used throughout the file, but each one must be specified using a Java system property.
More information about Logback variable substitution may be found here:

http://Logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html

The sample configuration also makes use of Logback's Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC) for consistently logging useful
information.  For example, the configuration file references the contextual key "transactionId", which will be
logged with every log statement sent to the service log.  It is the responsibility of the application to populate the
MDC with contextual information.  In order to use Logback's MDC, the application must first initialize an MDC finagle
adapter provided by finatra.  An example of initialization can be found here:

slf4j/src/main/scala/com/twitter/logging/filter/LoggingMDCFilter.scala

More information on Logback's MDC can be found here:

# Rerouting java.util.logging
# -------------------------------

Additional configuration is necessary to reroute java.util.logging logs.  The reason is that the jul-to-slf4j bridge
cannot replace classes in the java.util.logging package to do the redirection statically as it does for the other bridge
implementations. Instead it has to register a handler on the root logger and listen for logging statements like any
other handler. It will then redirect those logging statements.  This redirection is accomplished via SLF4J's
SLF4JBridgeHandler.  finatra-slf4j provides a Guice module for initializing this handler here:

finatra-slf4j/src/main/scala/com/twitter/logging/modules/Slf4jBridgeModule.scala

To use this module, simply include it with the application's other Guice modules.  Alternatively, an application can
initialize the handler directly as described here:
