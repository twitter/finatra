/**
 * EmbeddedThriftServer allows a twitter-server serving thrift endpoints to be started
 * locally (on ephemeral ports), and tested through it's thrift interfaces.
 *
 * @param twitterServer The twitter server to be started locally for integration testing
 * @param flags Command line Flags (e.g. "foo"->"bar" will be translated into -foo=bar) see: com.twitter.app.Flag
 * @param args Extra command line arguments. Could be flags, e.g, -foo=bar or other args, i.e, -Dfoo=bar -Xmx512M, etc.
 * @param waitForWarmup Once the app is started, wait for App warmup to be completed
 * @param stage Guice Stage used to create the server's injector. Since EmbeddedTwitterServer is used for testing, we default to Stage.DEVELOPMENT.
 *              This makes it possible to only mock objects that are used in a given test, at the expense of not checking that the entire
 *              object graph is valid. As such, you should always have at lease one Stage.PRODUCTION test for your service (which eagerly
 *              creates all Guice classes at startup)
 * @param useSocksProxy Use a tunneled socks proxy for external service discovery/calls (useful for manually run external integration tests that connect to external services)
 * @param skipAppMain Skip the running of appMain when the app starts. You will need to manually call app.appMain() later in your test.
 * @param thriftPortFlag Name of the flag that defines the external thrift port for the server.
